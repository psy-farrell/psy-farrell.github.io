title: New ipad = lush paper reviews

One nice feature of the new iPad (iPad 3.0, whatever) is that it has voice dictation built in. This isn't Siri, but simply a mechanism for talking loudly and unnaturally to the iPad and getting back a text transcription of what you said. This makes reviewing a breeze. I tend to mark up PDF's on the iPad with comments, and the voice transcription gets around using the software keyboard which, though OK, isn't really ideal for typing more than a few words.
