Just found a neat tool for OS X called
[GeekTool](http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/). It installs an item
in the preferences pane that allows you to show all kinds of geeky stuff
(CPU load, memory usage etc.) on your desktop. People have done some
pretty cool things with it, but my use is more mundane: just checking
that all my [hg
autosync](https://bitbucket.org/obensonne/hg-autosync/wiki/Home)
processes are up and running.
