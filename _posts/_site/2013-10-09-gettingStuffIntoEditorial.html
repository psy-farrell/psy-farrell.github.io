<p><a href="http://omz-software.com/editorial/">Editorial</a> is the new text editor on the block that has all the kids talking. Its two main features that set it apart from the other N markdown editors available on the iPad are a) Inline preview of markdown, in a very pretty format, and b) the thing is fully Python scriptable. A <a href="http://editorial-app.appspot.com/">compendium of workflows</a> shows all the cool stuff you can do with built in workflow components and Python scripting.</p>

<p>One issue with apps like this is getting docs in there in the first place. Many apps, Editorial included, can access a Dropbox account, and will by default set up their own directory in /Apps/. So one has a choice of manually moving documents to and from that directory, or making one’s entire working directory available to the app. This latter is overkill, so I was looking for an easy way to get stuff into and out of Editorial. The solution is to stick the following bash code into an automator service. When run on a file, it will move that file into the Editorial Dropbox directory, and create a placeholder file with extension “edi” in it’s place. Running the script on the “.edi” file will move the document back to its home (and delete the edi placeholder).</p>

<pre><code>
xpath=${1%/*} 
xbase=${1##*/}
xfext=${xbase##*.}
xpref=${xbase%.*}

editorialDir=&quot;/Your/Editorial/Dropbox/Directory&quot;

if [ &quot;$xfext&quot; == &quot;edi&quot; ]
then
    echo &quot;here!&quot;
    targName=`less $1`
    mv $editorialDir/$targName $xpath
    rm $1
else
    if [  -a $editorialDir/$xbase ]
    then
        COUNTER=2
        while [  -a $editorialDir/$xpref$COUNTER.$xfext ]; do
            let COUNTER=COUNTER+1
        done
        targName=$xbase$COUNTER.$xfext
    fi
    mv $1 $editorialDir/$targName
    echo &quot;$xpref$COUNTER.$xfext&quot; &gt; $xpath/$xpref.edi
fi
