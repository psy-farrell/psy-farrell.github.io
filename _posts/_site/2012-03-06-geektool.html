<p>Just found a neat tool for OS X called <a href="http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/">GeekTool</a>. It installs an item in the preferences pane that allows you to show all kinds of geeky stuff (CPU load, memory usage etc.) on your desktop. People have done some pretty cool things with it, but my use is more mundane: just checking that all my <a href="https://bitbucket.org/obensonne/hg-autosync/wiki/Home">hg autosync</a> processes are up and running.</p>
