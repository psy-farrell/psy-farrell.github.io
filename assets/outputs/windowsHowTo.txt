Notes:

1.    Please be aware that the simulation environment program installs Matlab Compiler Runtime (MCR) and the executable genwm.exe.  MCR is a large file and will take some time to download.

2.    On starting the application genwm.exe, the program may take a few seconds to start while MCR is starting up.
