I am looking to take on PhD students with a common interest in memory and/or decision-making, a solid background in cognitive psychology or a related discipline, and a genuine interest in research (including learning new skills such as programming). Funding is available to domestic students via [Australian Postgraduate Awards and University Postgraduate Awards funded by the Australian Government or UWA](http://www.scholarships.uwa.edu.au/search?sc_view=1&id=341&page=1&q=Australian+Postgraduate+Award&s=1&old_key=0), and the University makes available [additional scholarships](http://www.scholarships.uwa.edu.au/future-students/postgrad/prestigious) bequeathed by benefactors. Excellent international students also have a number of ways of [obtaining funding](http://www.scholarships.uwa.edu.au/future-students/postgrad/international). 

If you are interested, [get in touch](mailto:simon.farrell@uwa.edu.au). Note that I will not reply to form letters or obvious cases of mass emailing.
