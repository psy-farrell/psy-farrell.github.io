I am a Professor in the [School of  Psychological Science](http://www.psychology.uwa.edu.au) at the [University of Western Australia](http://www.uwa.edu.au). My research involves experiments on human beings guided by computational models. Research areas include working memory and episodic memory (particularly for order and time) and modelling of decision making.

My past and present collaborators include [Gordon Brown](https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/psych/people/gbrown/), [Geoff Ward](https://www.essex.ac.uk/psychology/staff/profile.aspx?ID=2453), Chris Jarrold, [Casimir Ludwig](http://casimir.psy.bris.ac.uk/), [Satoru Saito](http://www.educ.kyoto-u.ac.jp/cogpsy/member/saitos_e.htm), [Mark Hurlstone](http://mark-hurlstone.github.io), [David Leslie](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/maths/about-us/people/david-leslie), [Steve Lewandowsky](http://www.cogsciwa.com), [Klaus Oberauer](http://www.psychologie.uzh.ch/fachrichtungen/allgpsy/Team/Oberauer_en.html), Roland Baddeley, Iain Gilchrist, [Eric-Jan Wagenmakers](http://www.ejwagenmakers.com/) and [Roger Ratcliff](http://star.psy.ohio-state.edu/coglab/). Information on current students and the lab is [here](../members) 

I am Deputy Editor at the British Journal of Psychology. I was an Associate Editor for the [Journal of Memory and Language](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-memory-and-language) (2009-2011, 2018), and previously for [Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology](http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/pp/02724995.html) (2011-2016).

I teach a research+seminar unit that in previous years has covered reward and memory, and the psychology of science, and also teach in units on social psychology and theory and practice of psychology. In previous years I have taught about experimental methods (1st year), the psychology of science (3rd year), memory (2nd year), statistics (MSc), cognitive modelling (3rd year), neuropsychology (MSc), and the psychology of language (MSc).
